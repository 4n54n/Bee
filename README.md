This android app sends critical vibration alerts from one device to another, even when the receiver is in Do Not Disturb mode. It uses Firebase FCM data-only messages, allowing alerts to be delivered without running any background services. The vibration pattern is pre-planned and decided by the sender, ensuring intentional and meaningful alerts.
